told O
a O

He O
said O
further O
scientific O

if O
it O

that O

needed O
it O
should O
be O
taken O
by O
the O
European B-ORG

. O

He O
said O
a O
proposal O
last O

by O
EU U-ORG
Farm O

Franz B-PER
Fischler L-PER
to O
ban O
sheep O
brains O
, O
spleens O

from O

was O
a O
highly O
specific O
and O
precautionary O
move O
to O
protect O
human O
health O
. O

Fischler U-PER
proposed O
EU-wide U-MISC
measures O
after O
reports O

But O
Fischler U-PER
agreed O
to O
review O
his O
proposal O
after O
the O
EU U-ORG

standing O
veterinary O
committee O
, O
mational O
animal O
health O

, O
questioned O
if O
such O

there O
was O
only O
a O

to O

The O

hit O

last O

which O

Human O

lawyer O
Brian B-PER
Currin L-PER
said O
the O
hearings O
last O
week O
were O
not O
intended O
as O
a O
form O
of O
confessional O
and O
that O
those O
who O
personally O
committed O
crimes O
during O
apartheid O
would O
testify O
only O
before O
a O
separate O
arm O
of O
the O
commission O
, O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
one O
should O
have O
expected O
more O
than O
what O
one O
got O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O
" O

That O
was O
not O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
where O
perpetrators O
are O
expected O
to O
open O
their O
hearts O
and O
souls O
and O
to O
tell O
it O
all O
. O
" O

The O
commission O
, O
which O
has O
the O
power O
to O
grant O
amnesty O
to O
those O
who O
confess O
to O
abuses O
, O
has O
begun O
hearing O
the O
testimony O
from O
people O
already O
in O
jail O
for O
their O
deeds O
. O

But O
others O
, O
such O
as O
self-confessed O
secret O
police O
hit-squad O
leader O
Dirk B-PER
Coetzee L-PER
, O
have O
yet O
to O
testify O
. O

Tutu U-PER
's O
deputy O
chairman O
, O
Alex B-PER
Boraine L-PER
, O
told O
reporters O
the O
commission O
would O
begin O
issuing O
subpoenas O
to O
suspects O
who O
refused O
to O
appear O
voluntarily O
some O
time O
this O
week O
. O

He O
added O
that O
former O
hardline O
apartheid O
president O
P.W. B-PER
Botha L-PER
could O
be O
among O
those O
called O
. O

But O
Currin U-PER
, O
who O
is O
advising O
several O
people O
regarded O
as O
perpetrators O
, O
said O
this O
was O
not O
the O
best O
way O
to O
achieve O
the O
commission O
's O
aims O
. O

" O
A O
person O
can O
be O
forced O
to O
appear O
, O
but O
the O
only O
way O
one O
is O
going O
to O
get O
to O
the O
truth O
in O
its O
totality O
is O
if O
people O
feel O
it O
is O
a O
good O
idea O
to O
go O
to O
the O
amnesty O
committee O
. O

At O
the O
moment O
this O
is O
not O
the O
case O
. O
" O

He O
cited O
Coetzee U-PER
, O
who O
was O
charged O
with O
murder O
after O
confessing O
in O

interviews O
to O
dirty O
tricks O
. O

His O
trial O
is O
due O
to O
start O
in O
December O
but O
the O
truth O
commission O
intends O
to O
decide O
on O
his O
amnesty O
application O
before O
that O
. O

Currin U-PER
said O
the O
law O
had O
to O
be O
changed O
so O
all O
judicial O
prosecutions O
were O
automatically O
suspended O
for O
those O
who O
approached O

Last O

left O
many O
South B-MISC

unsatisfied O
. O

Boraine U-PER
said O
the O
picture O
was O
incomplete O
because O
officers O
of O
the O
apartheid-era O
security O
forces O
had O
yet O
to O
make O
their O
scheduled O
, O
separate O
submission O
, O
but O
one O
black O
caller O
to O
a O
radio O

declared O
: O

" O
This O
whole O
thing O
is O
utterly O
useless O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
help O
us O
at O
all O
. O

What O
the O
people O
expect O
is O
to O
have O
houses O
, O
to O
have O
jobs O
. O
" O

Political O
scientist O
Jannie B-PER
Gagiano L-PER
said O
he O
doubted O
that O
the O
National B-ORG

, O
which O
implemented O
apartheid O
in O
1948 O
and O
began O
dismantling O
it O
in O
1990 O
, O
felt O
it O
carried O
a O
burden O
of O
guilt O
and O
needed O
to O
be O
exculpated O
through O
the O
commission O
. O

" O
Therefore O
I O
have O
some O
doubts O
about O
achieving O
some O
form O
of O
reconciliation O

One O
has O
to O

Thousands O
of O

denounced O
Bosnia U-LOC

as O
a O
farce O
on O
Sunday O
because O
Serb U-MISC

be O
able O

Bosnia U-LOC

As O
a O
result O
, O
separatist O

have O
packed O

with O

of O

other O

Critics O
say O
that O
what O
was O
billed O
as O
an O
electoral O
process O
to O
reintegrate O
Bosnia U-LOC
as O
a O
single O
, O
multi-ethnic O

shaping O
up O

" O
Only O
our O

What O
it O
comes O
down O
to O
is O
this O
: O
If O
you O
're O
highly O

you O
'll O

the O

The O
way O

has O
tarnished O
the O

of O
this O
U.S. B-MISC

Martin U-PER

felt O
the O

organised O
an O
active O

" O
I O
feel O
that O
we O
made O
it O
a O

The O
suspicion O

forget O
about O

It O
was O

the O

up O
two O

Stich U-PER
, O
not O

might O

benefitted O
from O
some O
fiddling O

himself O
after O

insistence O
that O

A O

a O

Lebed U-PER
managed O
to O
arrange O
an O
ambitious O
ceasefire O
in O
the O

last O
week O

days O
after O
the O

threatened O

make O
this O

But O
then O
he O
apparently O
thought O
better O

he O
needed O
to O
tidy O
up O

cover O

could O

if O
the O

It O
is O
not O
known O
what O
caused O
the O
delay O
in O
the O
peace O

Speculation O
mounted O
last O
week O
that O
Lebed U-PER
was O
operating O
out O
on O
a O
limb O
in O
Chechnya U-LOC
as O
Yeltsin U-PER
, O
hardly O
seen O
since O
his O
reelection O
last O
month O
, O
kept O
out O
of O
sight O
and O
then O
gave O
an O
interview O
criticising O
his O
envoy O
just O
as O
he O
clinched O
a O
truce O
. O

But O
Chernomyrdin U-PER
took O
pains O
at O
the O
weekend O
to O
insist O
Lebed U-PER
was O
playing O
for O
a O
united O
team O
and O
that O
the O
proposals O
he O
took O
to O
rebel O
chief-of-staff O
Aslan B-PER
Maskhadov L-PER
had O
been O
agreed O
by O
Yeltsin U-PER
. O

If O
that O
were O
the O
case O
, O
it O
was O
unclear O
why O
Lebed U-PER
suddenly O
found O
it O
necessary O
to O
have O
the O
deal O
verified O
in O
Moscow U-LOC
. O

Lebed U-PER
himself O
said O
he O
was O
concerned O
that O
powerful O
interests O
in O
Moscow U-LOC
, O
who O
have O
profited O
from O
the O
war O
and O
want O
it O
to O
go O
on O
, O
would O
seize O
on O
any O
inadequacy O
in O
the O
deal O
to O
remove O
him O
. O

Maskhadov U-PER
warned O
that O
Lebed U-PER
risked O
the O
same O
fate O
as O
a O
former O
Russian U-MISC
army O
commander O
in O
the O
region O
who O
sought O
a O
compromise O
and O
was O
blown O
up O
last O
year O
by O
-- O
so O
the O
Chechens U-MISC
say O
-- O
Russian U-MISC
forces O
. O

Maskhadov U-PER
may O
also O
have O
made O
new O
demands O
on O
Lebed U-PER
, O
forcing O
him O
to O
check O
back O
with O
the O
Kremlin U-LOC
on O
what O
he O
could O
offer O
. O

A O
rebel O
spokesman O
said O
the O
two O
military O
men O
had O
come O
close O
to O
agreement O
on O
a O
face-saving O
formula O
acceptable O
to O
both O
sides O
and O
involving O
a O
referendum O
on O
independence O
at O
some O
future O
date O
. O

Chernomyrdin U-PER
said O
voters O
should O
decide O
Chechnya U-LOC
's O
future O
but O
stressed O
there O
was O
no O
question O
of O
the O
government O
letting O
the O
region O
quit O
the O
Russian B-LOC
Federation L-LOC
-- O
something O
Moscow U-LOC
fears O
could O
encourage O
separatist O
tendencies O
in O
other O
ethnic O
regions O
, O
particularly O
in O
the O
strategic O
North B-LOC
Caucasus L-LOC
. O

Lebed U-PER
may O
be O
be O
finding O
that O
closing O
that O
political O
gap O
between O
the O
two O
sides O
is O
more O
difficult O
than O
just O
ending O
a O
war O

The O
groups O
have O
targeted O
specific O
projects O
like O
the O
Newbury U-LOC
bypass O
and O
the O
M3 U-LOC
motorway O
through O
Twyford B-LOC
Down L-LOC
in O
the O
southern O
county O

Hampshire U-LOC

But O
they O
are O
also O
campaigning O
on O
broader O
issue O
such O
as O
stopping O
the O
government O
road O
building O
programme O
and O
out-of-town O
superstores O
which O
they O
say O
create O
more O
traffic O
, O
pollution O
and O
damage O
local O
communities O

The O
government O
has O
slashed O
its O
road-building O

Although O
protests O
may O
have O
contributed O
to O
the O
decision O
it O
has O
been O
seen O
primarily O
as O
economic O
rather O

ecological O

Graham B-PER

, O
said O
: O
" O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
many O
firms O
involved O
in O
tendering O
for O
sensitive O
projects O
realise O
the O

on O
the O

" O

they O
are O
more O

than O
they O
were O
3-4 O

There O

no O
doubt O
it O

a O
big O

now O

" O

He O
says O
the O
damage O
comes O
in O
two O
forms O
: O
" O
Tangible O
-- O
in O
the O
form O
of O
extra O
costs O
, O
additional O
security O
, O
threats O
to O
staff O
and O
the O
more O
intangible O
damage O
caused O
by O
negative O
publicity O
. O
" O

Watts U-PER
said O
the O
cost O
of O
protesting O
can O
be O
heavy O
once O
the O
company O
is O
locked O
into O
a O
contract O
. O

" O
I O
do O
often O
hear O
on O
the O
industry O
circuit O
of O
tales O
where O
the O
company O
tenders O
at O
low O
margins O
and O
the O
demonstrations O
which O
follow O
means O
they O
are O
running O
the O
project O
at O
a O
loss O

this O

" O

Both O

, O
the O
analysts O
said O
. O

Despite O
the O
current O
difficulties O
, O
however O
, O
analysts O
were O
convinced O
that O
Cofinec U-ORG
's O
outlook O
was O
strong O
. O

" O
The O
eastern O
European U-MISC
market O
offers O
good O
chances O
, O
" O
said O
Erdei U-PER
. O
" O

Just O
like O
many O
other O
companies O
on O
the O
bourse O
, O
Cofinec U-ORG
has O
big O
growth O
opportunities O
. O
" O

" O
At O
the O
same O
time O
, O
it O
's O
an O
advantage O
for O
Cofinec U-ORG
that O
it O
has O
a O
foreign O
management O
which O
perhaps O
understands O
the O
market O
better O
, O
" O
Erdei U-PER
added O
. O

" O
Cofinec U-ORG
is O
a O
very O
good O
story O
in O
the O
long-term O
as O
the O
per O
capita O
packaging O
consumption O
is O
still O
so O
low O
in O
east O
Europe U-LOC
that O
a O
very O
strong O
increase O
can O
be O
expected O
( O
long-term O
) O
, O
" O
Sitanyi U-PER
said O
, O
saying O
that O
several O
recent O
moves O
by O
Cofinec U-ORG
boosted O
its O
position O
. O

Among O
them O
, O
he O
noted O
that O
Cofinec U-ORG
had O
acquired O
the O
outstanding O
stake O
in O
its O
Czech U-MISC
folding O
company O
Krpaco B-ORG
a.s. L-ORG
, O
increasing O
its O
ownership O
to O
100 O
percent O
, O
so O
in O
the O
second O
half O
the O
whole O
of O
Krpaco U-ORG
's O
figures O
will O
be O
consolidated O
. O

The O
company O
also O
repaid O
some O
$ O
21 O
million O
of O
debt O
, O
well O
above O
the O
originally O
planned O
$ O
8 O
million O
to O
$ O
9 O
million O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
its O
Polish U-MISC
operation O
began O
with O
some O
six O
weeks O
of O
delay O
due O
to O
cold O
winter O
weather O

He O
said O

it O

According O
to O

pressed O

to O
coerce O

the O
effect O

The O

The O

has O
kept O

A O

Under O

, O
the O

no O

only O

Meri U-PER

not O

His O
support O
in O
the O
first O

on O

was O
much O
lower O
than O
expected O
, O
scoring O
only O
45 O

, O
which O
political O
analysts O
put O
down O
as O
a O
vote O
of O
no O
confidence O
in O
his O
performance O
. O

This O
support O
only O
inched O
up O
to O
49 O
in O
the O
second O

. O

Support O
for O
Ruutel U-PER
, O
68 O
, O
remained O
constant O
at O

If O
the O

give O
either O

" O
These O
rules O
are O
intended O
to O
empower O
all O
investors O
, O
by O
allowing O
their O
orders O
to O
compete O
on O
a O
level O
playing O
field O
, O
and O
by O
providing O
the O
disclosure O
they O
need O
to O
make O
informed O
decisions O
, O
" O
said O
SEC U-ORG
Chairman O
Arthur B-PER
Levitt L-PER
. O

The O
SEC U-ORG
's O
goal O
, O
he O
added O
, O
was O
to O
create O
" O
one O
system O
where O
one O
price O
could O
be O
available O
to O
everybody O
. O
" O

The O
director O
of O
the O
SEC U-ORG
's O
division O
of O
market O
regulation O
, O
Richard B-PER
Lindsey L-PER
, O
said O
Wall B-LOC
Street L-LOC
firms O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
spend O
about O
$ O
7 O
million O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
improvements O
called O
for O
by O
the O
new O
rules O
. O

In O
proposing O
the O
rules O
last O
year O
, O
the O
SEC U-ORG
noted O
that O
while O
technology O
has O
improved O
, O
commonplace O
practices O
still O
existed O
that O
worked O
against O
investors O
' O
best O
interests O
. O

It O
noted O
that O
customers O
whose O
orders O
were O
not O
displayed O
lost O
the O
chance O
of O
getting O
the O
best O
possible O
price O
available O
in O
the O
market O
. O

It O
also O
cited O
the O
potential O
problem O
of O
a O
two-tiered O
market O
in O
which O
market O
makers O
quote O
one O
price O
to O
public O
investors O
while O
quoting O
better O
prices O
in O
private O
systems O
, O
thus O
robbing O
investors O
without O
access O
to O
" O
hidden O
" O
quotes O
the O
benefit O
of O
the O
best O
available O
prices O
. O

Earlier O
this O
month O
, O
the O
SEC U-ORG
settled O
charges O
of O
alleged O
malpractices O
on O
Nasdaq U-MISC
when O
the O

of O
the O
Nasdaq U-MISC

, O
the O
National B-ORG

, O
agreed O
to O
spend O
$ O
100 O
million O
over O
five O
years O
to O
upgrade O
its O
oversight O
of O
brokers O
' O
trading O
practices O
. O

The O
SEC U-ORG
dropped O
a O
third O
proposal O
that O
would O
have O
allowed O
investors O
with O
market O
orders O
to O
trade O
at O
a O
better O
price O
if O
there O
were O
shifts O
in O
prices O
before O
their O
orders O
were O
executed O
. O

The O
agency O
said O
it O
would O
monitor O
effects O
of O
the O
two O
new O
rules O
before O
considering O
the O
" O
price O
improvement O
" O
proposal O
again O
. O

The O
agency O
also O
proposed O
rule O
changes O
that O
would O
require O
continuous O
" O
bid O
" O
and O
" O
ask O
" O
quotations O
from O
exchange O
specialists O
and O
market O
makers O
who O
trade O
more O
than O
1 O
percent O
of O
a O
stock O
during O
any O
quarter O
on O
Nasdaq U-MISC
. O

The O
SEC U-ORG

mean O
a O
major O

exchanged O
his O
reputation O
as O
the O
clown O
prince O
of O

on O

for O
a O

no-nonsense O
attitude O
that O

on O

" O
I O

in O
the O
opening O

It O
was O
Medvedev U-PER

sixth O
victory O
in O
a O

after O
winning O
his O
first O
tournament O
of O
the O
year O
last O
week O
at O
the O
Hamlet B-MISC
Cup L-MISC
. O

" O
I O
realised O
this O
year O
, O
that O
without O
putting O
99.9 O
percent O
of O
your O
mind O
into O
tennis O
, O
I O
do O
n't O
think O
you O
can O
successful O
, O
" O
said O
the O
22-year-old O
Medvedev U-PER
. O

" O
The O
whole O
day O
I O
'm O
thinking O
abnout O
tennis O

I O
felt O
that O
all O
the O
other O

they O
were O
distracting O
me O
, O
they O
were O
not O

me O
at O
all O
. O
" O

For O
Medvedev U-PER
that O
meant O
confining O
his O
post-match O
comments O
to O
tennis O
and O
not O
going O
off O
on O
tirades O
about O
about O
peripheral O

such O
as O
the O
poor O
quality O
of O

an O

took O
his O

off O

" O
I O

the O
last O
two O
years O

the O

his O

as O
a O

" O
I O

I O
have O
much O
more O

on O

" O
he O
said O
. O

Just O
three O
years O
ago O
Medvedev U-PER
was O
one O
of O
the O
world O

best O
, O
with O
a O
ranking O
of O
six O
after O
reaching O
the O
French B-MISC

semifinal O
and O
winning O
three O
tournaments O
. O

But O
Medvedev U-PER
's O
ranking O
slowly O
began O
to O
drop O
last O
year O
as O
he O
struggled O
with O
a O
wrist O
injury O
. O

The O
Ukrainian U-MISC
finally O
hit O
a O
low O
of O
44th O
two O

" O
It O

somewhere O
where O
I O
would O
n't O
like O
to O
stay O
very O
long O
, O
" O
Medvedev U-PER
said O
of O
his O
current O
ranking O
of O
36 O
. O
" O

It O
's O
a O
part O
of O
the O
penalty O
that O
I O
have O
to O
accept O
. O
" O

As O
part O
of O
his O
new O
businesslike O

, O
Medvedev U-PER
hired O

While O
Medvedev U-PER

rather O
ordinary O

the O
fact O
that O
the O
two O

was O
rather O
remarkable O

In O
the O
original O

Medvedev U-PER

The O
European B-ORG

said O
on O
Thursday O
it O
would O
study O
scientific O
reports O
saying O
Britain U-LOC
's O
mad O
cow O
epidemic O
would O
die O
out O
by O
2001 O
but O
offered O
little O
prospect O
the O
findings O
would O
change O
an O
agreed O
slaughter O
campaign O
. O

" O
Obviously O
we O
are O
interested O
in O
this O
research O
. O

We O
will O
ask O
the O
( O
EU U-ORG
) O
scientific O
and O
veterinary O
committee O
to O
examine O
it O
, O
" O
Commission U-ORG
spokesman O
Gerard B-PER
Kiely L-PER
told O
Reuters U-ORG
. O

But O
he O
added O
that O
new O
research O
into O
the O
dynamics O
of O
the O
bovine O
spongiform O
encephalopathy O
( O
BSE U-MISC
) O
, O
a O
fatal O
brain-wasting O
disease O
suffered O
by O
cattle O
, O
was O
unlikely O
to O
alter O
a O
slaughter O
plan O
agreed O
by O
Britain U-LOC
and O
its O
14 O
EU U-ORG
partners O
. O

" O
We O
agreed O
that O
following O
detailed O
scientific O
analysis O
using O
a O
methodology O
which O
would O
take O
out O
the O
maximum O
number O
of O
BSE U-MISC
cases O
possible O
. O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
very O
difficult O
to O
sell O
to O
the O
European B-ORG
Commission L-ORG
a O
programme O
which O
would O
involve O
the O
elimination O
of O
fewer O
BSE U-MISC
cases O
, O
" O
Kiely U-PER
said O
. O

" O
We O
will O
look O
at O
our O
approach O
( O
to O
the O
plan O
) O
but O
we O
wo O
n't O
get O
involved O
with O
the O
number O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
" O
he O
said O
. O

" O
We O
have O
always O
avoided O
the O
question O
of O
numbers O
of O
animals O
to O
be O
slaughtered O
, O
that O
's O
not O
the O
issue O
. O

The O
issue O
is O
the O
protection O
of O
consumers O
' O
health O
and O
the O
rapid O
eradication O
of O
BSE U-MISC
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

The O
reaction O
is O
likely O
to O
disappoint O
British U-MISC
farmers O
, O
who O
seized O
on O
research O
by O
Oxford U-ORG
scientists O
in O
the O
scientific O
journal O
Nature U-ORG
saying O
it O
would O
be O
hard O

rid O
of O
the O
disease O
any O
faster O
than O
2001 O
without O
killing O
vast O
numbers O
of O
cattle O
. O

The O
researchers O
predicted O
there O
would O
be O
340 O
new O
infections O
and O
14,000 O
new O
cases O
of O
BSE U-MISC
before O
2001 O
. O

British U-MISC

' O

called O
on O
Wednesday O

an O
urgent O
meeting O

to O
discuss O
the O
report O
. O

" O
I O
hope O
the O
government O
will O
now O
make O
it O
clear O
they O
believe O
there O
is O
a O

Sir O
David B-PER

told O

Naish U-PER
said O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
Britain U-LOC
to O
carry O
out O
a O
planned O
cull O
of O
some O
147,000 O
cattle O
to O
which O
it O
had O
reluctantly O
agreed O
to O
placate O
its O
European U-MISC
partners O
. O

" O
The O
new O
evidence O
to O
me O
means O
some O
of O
that O
proposal O
should O
be O
re-examined O
because O
we O
could O
get O
away O
with O
considerably O
less O

culled O

in O
fact O
scientists O
throughout O
Europe U-LOC
accepted O
this O
evidence O
, O
" O
Naish U-PER
said O
. O

The O
report O
could O
well O
reopen O
a O
damaging O
row O
between O

the O
EU U-ORG

which O
slapped O

said O
on O
Thursday O
the O

confident O
about O

general O
prospects O

despite O
pressure O
from O
unsettled O
markets O
. O

In O
an O
interview O
following O
its O
first-half O
results O
, O
which O
included O
a O
less O
optimistic O
forecast O
for O
the O
second O
half O
of O
this O
year O
than O
it O
had O
made O
in O
the O

, O
Sir O
Colin B-PER
Hope L-PER
said O
T&N U-ORG
had O
taken O
defensive O
action O
to O
protect O
it O
from O
patchy O
markets O
. O

Looking O
at O
market O
prospects O
, O
he O
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
our O
best O
judgment O
at O
this O
stage O
is O
that O
it O
will O
probably O
bumble O
along O
in O
the O
rather O
mixed O
way O
it O
's O
been O
in O
the O
first O
half O
. O
" O

" O
It O
's O
very O
difficult O
to O
predict O
the O
market O
( O
trend O
) O
this O
year O
. O

It O
could O
be O
better O
, O
or O
it O
could O
be O
worse O

" O
Hope U-PER
added O

echoing O
the O
demand O
uncertainty O
across O

" O
You O
can O
see O

in O
particular O
, O
beginning O

America U-LOC
, O
however O
, O
is O
looking O
a O
little O
better O

" O
he O
said O
. O

Compared O
with O
the O
end O
of O
last O
year O
, O
when O
T&N U-ORG
predicted O
a O
sluggish O
first O
half O
and O
a O
rebound O
later O
in O
1996 O
, O
Hope U-PER
said O
: O
" O
I O
think O
the O
difference O
( O
now O
) O
is O
the O
first O
half O
has O
not O
actually O
been O
as O
bad O
as O
some O
felt O
it O
was O
going O
to O
be O
, O
but O
equally O
we O
're O
certainly O
not O
predicting O
a O
recovery O
in O
the O
second O
half O
. O
" O

Against O
this O
background O
, O
Hope U-PER
said O
the O
group O
was O
glad O
it O
had O
rationalised O
and O
destocked O
even O
though O
this O
had O
pressed O
margins O
, O
which O
had O
slipped O
to O
9.5 O
percent O
from O
11.3 O
percent O
a O
year O
ago O
. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
figure O
of O
9.5 O
percent O
on O
the O
first O
half O
, O
when O
you O
consider O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
've O
been O
destocking O
, O
the O
fairly O
mixed O
customer O
demand O
, O
and O
the O
fact O
that O
we O
sold O
the O
( O
southern O
African U-MISC
) O
mines O
actually O
is O
not O
bad O
. O

" O
It O
does O
show O
how O
easily O
we O
should O
be O
able O
to O
bounce O
back O
over O
10 O
percent O
again O
, O
" O
he O
added O
, O
saying O
: O
" O
We O
continue O
to O
feel O
very O
relaxed O
about O
our O
general O
view O
that O
we O
would O
average O
10 O
percent O
profit O
margins O
over O
the O
cycle O
. O
" O

" O
We O
've O
always O
taken O
the O
view O
that O
we O
are O
the O
sort O
of O
company O
that O
's O
quite O
capable O
of O
working O
in O
difficult O
circumstances O
-- O
we O
're O
rather O
used O

it O

And O
we O
feel O
very O
confident O
that O
we O
're O
doing O
all O
the O
right O

" O
Hope U-PER
said O
. O

" O
When O
the O
( O

The O
outcome O
of O
the O

emerged O
as O
a O
hot O
topic O
on O
Wall B-LOC
Street L-LOC
this O

as O
financial O
pundits O
debated O
whether O

forgo O
a O
second O
term O
as O
Treasury U-ORG
secretary O
if O
President O

Concern O
centred O
on O
the O
currency O

since O
Rubin U-PER
's O
tour O
de O
force O
has O
been O
his O
unflagging O
support O
of O
the O

. O

Speculation O
that O
Rubin U-PER
might O
not O
stay O
in O
his O
post O
grew O
after O
he O
sidestepped O
questions O
about O
any O
future O
Cabinet U-ORG
post O
during O

interviews O
at O
the O
Democratic U-MISC
convention O
in O
Chicago U-LOC
this O

Should O
Rubin U-PER
leave O
, O
Wall B-LOC

would O
worry O
that O
he O
might O
take O
his O
strong-dollar O

him O
. O

Rubin U-PER

predecessor O
at O
the O
Treasury U-ORG
, O
Lloyd B-PER
Bentsen L-PER
, O
was O
viewed O
with O
suspicion O

had O
tried O
to O
push O
down O

gain O

" O

" O
Under O

certainly O
looked O
for O

" O

That O

Rubin U-PER
was O
widely O
hailed O
as O
the O
architect O
of O
the O

comeback O
, O
using O
skills O
and O

gained O
in O

" O
Rubin U-PER
has O
done O
a O
fine O
job O
in O
that O
position O
, O
" O
said O
Michael B-PER
Faust L-PER
, O
a O

" O
Anyone O

would O
come O
in O
there O
to O
replace O
him O
would O
have O
awfully O
big O
shoes O
to O

" O

Fear O
that O
a O
new O
Treasury U-ORG
secretary O
might O
favour O
a O
return O
to O
Bentsen-era U-MISC
policy O
could O
spell O
trouble O
for O

As O
for O
U.S. B-ORG
Treasury L-ORG
securities O
, O
Widness U-PER
explained O
that O
Alan B-PER
Greenspan L-PER
's O
reappointment O
as O
chairman O
of O
the O
Federal B-ORG
Reserve L-ORG
and O
the O
outlook O
for O
the O
federal O
budget O
were O
more O
important O
than O
whether O
Rubin U-PER
continues O
at O
the O
Treasury U-ORG
. O

" O
Although O
, O
if O
we O
did O
get O
someone O
that O
was O
seen O
as O
looking O
for O
a O
dollar O
depreciation O
, O
it O
would O
probably O
hurt O
capital O
flows O
to O
the O
United B-LOC
States L-LOC
, O
" O
said O
Widness U-PER
, O
adding O
that O
could O
hurt O
U.S. U-LOC
stocks O
and O
, O
to O
a O
lesser O
degree O
, O
bonds O
. O

Still O
, O
markets O
may O
have O
little O
to O
fear O
from O
any O
Rubin U-PER
successor O
because O
the O
firm O
dollar O
policy O
has O
yielded O
positive O
results O
. O

If O
that O
is O
true O
, O
then O
any O
new O
Treasury U-ORG
chief O
would O
need O
to O
be O
as O
effective O
as O
Rubin U-PER
in O
convincing O
markets O
that O
the O
White B-LOC
House L-LOC
does O
indeed O
want O
a O
strong O
currency O
. O

" O
If O
he O
left O

the O
first O
question O
people O
would O
ask O

next O

" O
And O
all O
I O
can O
say O
