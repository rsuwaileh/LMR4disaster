The O

had O
to O
wriggle O
out O

a O

the O

Washington O
, O
who O
climbed O
back O
from O
a O
1-5 O
deficit O
, O
two O
sets O
down O
in O
the O
third O
set O
against O
Todd O
Martin O
in O
the O
Wimbledon O
semifinals O
, O
looked O
poised O
for O
another O
sensational O
comeback O
. O

O'Brien O
, O
a O
winner O
two O
weeks O
ago O
in O
New B-LOC
Haven L-LOC
for O
his O
first O
pro O
title O
, O
served O
for O
the O
match O
at O
5-4 O
in O
the O
third O
set O
before O
Washington O
came O
charging O
back O
. O

" O
I O
just O
kept O
saying O
to O
myself O
, O
' O
keep O
giving O
yourself O
the O
best O
chance O
to O
win O
, O
keep O
battling O
, O
maybe O
something O
will O
happen O
, O
' O
" O
said O
the O
26-year-old O
O'Brien O
, O
ranked O
65th O
. O

" O
I O
kept O
my O
composure O
and O
I O
was O
proud O
of O
myself O
for O
that O
-- O
usually O
I O
would O
have O
folded O
up O
the O
tent O
and O
gone O
home O
. O
" O

The O
hard-serving O
O'Brien O
, O
a O
former O
U.S. U-LOC
collegiate O
national O
champion O
, O
fired O
up O
17 O
aces O
to O
ultimately O
subdue O
the O
never-say-die O
Washington O
. O

The O
fifth O
set O
stayed O
on O
serve O
until O
the O
sixth O
game O
, O
when O
Washington O
, O
after O
saving O
one O
break O
point O
with O
a O
forehand O
winner O
down O
the O
line O
, O
netted O
a O
backhand O
to O
give O
O'Brien O
a O
4-2 O
lead O
. O

The O
Texan O
blasted O
in O
two O
aces O
to O
hold O
serve O
at O
5-2 O
and O
then O
converted O
his O
eighth O
match O
point O
for O
victory O
when O
Washington O
found O
the O
net O
with O
another O
backhand O
from O
40-0 O

" O
You O
just O
kind O
of O
keep O
fighting O
and O
you O
keep O
trying O
to O
make O
him O
play O
a O
little O

I O
think O
he O
got O
a O
little O
tight O
at O

couple O
of O
moments O

fine O

" O

" O

I O

said O
there O
are O
some O
unusual O
risks O
for O

The O
trick O

for O

The O
surge O
of O

come O
amid O

that O

U.S. O
Agriculture O
Department O
officials O
said O
Friday O
that O
Mexican O
avocados O
-- O
which O
are O
restricted O
from O
entering O
the O
continental O
United B-LOC
States L-LOC
-- O
will O
not O
likely O
be O
entering O
U.S. U-LOC
markets O
any O
time O
soon O
, O
even O
if O
the O
controversial O
ban O
were O
lifted O
today O
. O

" O
The O
opportunity O
to O
import O
( O
Mexican O
avocados O
) O
probably O
wo O
n't O
become O
possible O
for O
another O
year O
, O
" O
said O
Paul O
Drazek O
, O
senior O
trade O
advisor O
to O
Agriculture O
Secretary O
Dan O
Glickman O
. O

" O
We O
could O
lift O
the O
ban O
tomorrow O
, O
but O
that O
would O
not O
mean O
anything O
immediately O
, O
" O
said O
Drazek O
. O
" O

We O
probably O
would O
not O
see O
avacados O
come O
in O
until O
next O
season O
, O
next O
November O
. O
" O

The O
Agriculture O
Department O
proposed O
more O
than O
a O
year O
ago O
to O
significantly O
ease O
an O
82-year O
ban O
on O
Mexican O
avocados O
. O

Under O
the O
administration O
's O
proposal O
, O
the O
borders O
to O
the O
Mexican O
produce O
would O
be O
opened O
into O
19 O
Northern O
and O
Northeastern O
states O
from O
November O
through O
February O
. O

The O
plan O
has O
raised O
a O
storm O
of O
protest O
from O
U.S. U-LOC
avocado O
growers O
, O
who O
are O
largely O
concentrated O
in O
California U-LOC
. O

California U-LOC
growers O
have O
charged O
that O
removing O
the O
restrictions O
, O
even O
on O
a O
limited O
basis O
, O
would O
endanger O
the O
$ O
1 O
billion O
U.S. U-LOC
industry O
if O
potentially O
harmful O
Mexican O
insects O
were O
brought O
into O
the O
country O
along O
with O
the O
avocados O
. O

Mexican O
officials O
contend O
that O
there O
is O
no O
scientific O
basis O
for O
the O
ban O
, O
and O
that O
it O
is O
illegal O
under O
international O
trading O
rules O
of O
the O
World O
Trade O
Organisation O
. O

Proponents O
of O
the O
plan O
discount O
the O
worries O
of O
the O
U.S. U-LOC
growers O
and O
say O
the O
plan O
has O
enough O
safeguards O
built O
into O
it O
to O
eliminate O
any O
significant O
threat O
to O
American O
producers O
. O

Under O
the O
proposal O
, O
only O
imports O
of O
export-quality O
avocados O
growing O
in O
approved O
orchards O
in O
Michoacan U-LOC
, O
Mexico U-LOC
, O
the O
country O
's O
main O
avocado O
area O
, O
would O
be O
allowed O
. O

Mexican O
growers O
and O
distributors O
would O
have O
to O
abide O
by O
strict O
rules O
established O
by O
the O
Mexican O
and O
U.S. U-LOC
agriculture O
agencies O
. O

The O
California O
Avocado O
Commission O
-- O
which O
has O
spearheaded O
the O
opposition O
to O
lifting O
the O
ban O
-- O
said O
new O
data O
the O
group O
submitted O
to O
the O
Agriculture O
Department O
last O
spring O
shows O
the O
department O
underestimated O
the O
pest O
problem O
in O
Mexico U-LOC
and O
have O
urged O
that O
the O
agency O
reopen O
its O
study O
of O
the O
issue O
. O

The O
administration O
is O
still O
studying O
the O
new O
data O
, O
and O
officials O
have O
said O
that O
if O
experts O
think O
the O
information O
is O
significant O
, O
the O
agency O
could O
reopen O
its O
investigation O
. O

But O
U.S. U-LOC
avocado O
industry O
sources O
said O
that O
while O
they O
may O
have O
delayed O
the O
plan O
for O
a O
while O
, O
they O
ultimately O
do O
not O
expect O
the O
administration O
to O
change O
its O
position O
. O

" O
From O
a O
common-sense O
view O
, O
the O
department O
should O
reconsider O
this O
plan O
, O
but O
due O
to O
politics O
they O
will O
probably O
go O
ahead O
with O
this O
, O
" O

Tom O

The O

previously O
that O
spending O

partly O
because O

Justin O

a O

in O
the O
first O
40 O
minutes O
which O
could O
have O
put O
his O
side O
ahead O
, O
but O
it O
was O
the O
Springboks O
who O
looked O
the O
more O
dangerous O
. O

Their O
promise O
was O
realised O
when O
Joubert O
made O
a O
40-metre O
break O
in O
the O
25th O
minute O
and O
, O
although O

appeared O
to O
knock O
on O
Joubert O

reverse O
pass O

1996-08-31 O

Controversial O
Australian O
Anthony O
Hill O
called O
Jansher O

cheat O
during O
his O
acrimonious O
defeat O
by O
the O
world O
number O

in O
the O
Hong O

The O
match O
boiled O
over O
when O
Hill O
made O
to O
walk O
off O
court O
after O
what O
he O
claimed O
was O
a O
game-winning O
point O
in O
the O
third O
. O

When O
the O
referee O
called O
Jansher O
's O
return O
good O
and O
the O
decision O
was O
accepted O
by O
the O
player O
, O
Hill O
shrieked O
at O
the O
Pakistani O
: O
" O
You O
cheat O
. O
" O

" O
He O
was O
standing O
right O
there O
and O
knew O
the O
shot O
was O
down O
so O
I O
called O
him O
a O
cheat O
, O
" O
said O
Hill O
, O
whose O
squash O
career O
has O
been O
blighted O
by O
fines O
and O
suspensions O
for O
unacceptable O
behaviour O
. O

" O
He O
knew O
it O
was O
down O
and O
accepted O
what O
I O
called O
him O
because O
of O
that O
. O
" O

Hill O
won O
the O
game O
on O
the O
next O
point O
and O
said O
later O
that O
Jansher O
was O
generally O
honest O
on O
court O
but O
played O
by O
the O
referee O
's O
decision O
. O

The O
Australian O
had O
upset O
Jansher O
's O
rhythm O
with O
his O
mixture O
of O
gamesmanship O
and O
fluent O
stroke-making O
but O
eventually O
succumbed O
15-7 O
17-15 O
14-15 O
15-8 O
. O

" O
I O
changed O
my O
strategy O
against O
him O
today O
and O
had O
him O
rattled O
, O
" O
he O
added O
. O

He O
is O
not O
as O
fit O
as O
he O
used O
to O
be O
be O
but O
was O
too O
good O
for O
me O
in O
the O
end O
. O

I O
shook O
him O
a O
bit O
but O
he O
will O
come O
out O
next O
time O
and O
be O
a O
better O
player O
for O
it O
-- O
that O
's O
Jansher O
. O
" O

Jansher O
said O
that O
he O
was O
disturbed O
to O
be O
called O
a O
cheat O
. O
" O

What O
he O
did O
was O
bad O
for O
squash O
, O
bad O
for O
the O
crowd O
and O
bad O
for O
the O
sponsors O
. O

" O
We O
are O
trying O
to O
build O
up O
squash O
like O
tennis O
and O
players O
should O
not O
say O
things O
like O
that O
. O

" O
I O
think O
the O
Professional O
Squash O
Association O
should O
look O
into O
this O
matter O
and O
deal O
with O
it O
properly O
. O

I O
am O
not O
calling O
for O
him O
to O
be O
banned O
but O
they O
have O
to O
take O
some O
action O

, O
said O
that O
he O
would O

good O
of O

" O
I O

the O

with O
three O

France U-LOC
injected O
more O
sting O
in O

with O
the O
introduction O
of O

This O
allowed O

his O

with O
a O
hard-fought O
2-1 O
victory O
over O
10-man O
Turkey U-LOC
in O
a O
tense O
match O
marred O
by O
Turkish O
crowd O
trouble O
shortly O
after O
the O
break O
. O

Turkish O
fans O
, O
upset O
at O
their O
team O
's O
2-0 O
first-half O
deficit O
, O
ripped O
apart O
dozens O
of O
plastic O
seats O
and O
threw O
them O
over O
the O
fence O
. O

Riot O
police O
took O
10 O
minutes O
to O
restore O
order O
. O

The O
police O
were O
given O
an O
unexpected O
hand O
by O
second-half O
substitute O
Sergen O
Yalcin O
who O
rekindled O
Turkish O
hopes O
in O
the O
61st O
with O
a O
splendid O
half-volley O
which O
stunned O
Belgian O
goalkeeper O
Filip O
De O
Wilde O
. O

But O
Yalcin O
, O
who O
had O
come O
on O
just O
four O
minutes O
earlier O
, O
turned O
from O
hero O
to O
villain O
barely O
two O
minutes O
after O
his O
strike O
when O
he O
was O
sent O
off O
after O
spitting O
at O
an O
opponent O
and O
arguing O
with O
English O

David O

. O

Marc O
Degryse O
had O
opened O
the O
scoring O
for O
Belgium U-LOC
after O
13 O
minutes O
, O
whacking O
a O
low O
10-metre O
drive O
into O
the O
net O
after O
an O
incisive O
pass O
by O
defender O
Dirk O

from O
the O
edge O
of O
the O

area O
. O

Brazilian-born O

then O
gleefully O
slipped O
the O
ball O
past O
goalkeeper O
Rustu O
Recber O
from O
the O
right O
of O
the O
area O
to O
make O
it O
2-0 O
seven O
minutes O
before O
the O
interval O
, O
Turkey U-LOC

best O
first-half O
effort O

to O
be O
a O
vicious O
30-metre O
shot O
by O
Ogun O
Temizkanoglu O
which O
De O
Wilde O
tipped O
over O
. O

The O
visitors O
, O
seeking O
to O
restore O
some O
pride O
after O
failing O
to O
score O
a O
single O
goal O
in O
Euro O
96 O
in O
June O
, O
repeatedly O
ripped O
through O
the O
left O
side O
of O
the O
home O
defence O
but O
De O
Wilde O
was O
able O
to O
block O
several O
sharply-angled O
efforts O
. O

With O
only O
the O
group O
seven O
winners O
qualifying O
automatically O
for O
the O
1998 O
finals O
in O
France U-LOC
, O
Belgium U-LOC
could O
not O
afford O
a O
slip-up O
at O
home O
and O
they O
frantically O
chased O
a O
decisive O
third O
goal O
. O

But O
they O
were O
almost O
upset O
12 O
minutes O
from O
time O
when O
De O

fumbled O
a O
hard O
Arif O

and O

over O
